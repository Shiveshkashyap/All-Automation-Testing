Phase 1 : Implementation
-->Create a maven Project: Done
--> update the POM xml file: done
-->Create Page Objects: Done {ex:LoginPage, Add customer, delete customer .. etc} details dena hai jaise ki x path and method bnana hai
-->Create Basic Test cases : done{kya sb action lena hai wo}
--> Add logs to Test Cases{Fpr this we have to add dependcy in Maven "log4j", or install the jar} logs dekhne k liye kya sb execute hua--> it is not showing in IntellijIdea
-->Read common value from properties file{for this we create a configure poerpties file , wo same hota Txt ke jaisa , jisme hum wo sara chz jo
ki Base class me hai jaise String ko hardcoded krke rkhe hai, usse properties file me rkh dengey then fir ek read config file bnayengey}
"""****** ReadConfig class ek "Utilities package k ander me bnayengey properties file ko read krne k liye****""

-->Run test case on Desired Browser: done{all details written Using testNg xml we can do this or in utilities package , some else if condition for setup}
-->Add Extent report: Description Below : line 40
-->Adding New testCases

********* Now Time to write Test Case****
Before that , try to create a Page object in which all Page object thing is there , then 1 package for test case
similarly for Test Data and test Utilities.
We can also create a folder to store Screenshot as evidences. configuration files also and Driver file(if needed)

******** So whenever trying to create Test case ** follows 3 rule*********8
--> 1.For Test setup create one Method(means:all the prerequisite {means : system.set property, Timer Object all these}-
This should be executed before class

--> 2.for actual Test case creation one method-> actual all the test steps mentioned here.
--> 3.for ending the process or tear-down one method = related to closer , quit command

*** So these 3 process should be for every test case we have to follow this.

As Point1 and Point3 is same for all the Test Cases we can kept these 2 in one place . that is "Base class."
and we extend or all Test class to Base class.


-->Add Extent report: Description Below*****
Prerequisite for Extent report
1. jar (Pom will take care of this)
2. extent-config.xml (file)-> configuration file
3.lestener class(Report.java)->utility file {in which we write what on test pass , test success all these}
